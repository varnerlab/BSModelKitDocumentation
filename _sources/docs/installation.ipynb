    "## Introduction\n",
    "The `BSTModelKit.jl` package is written the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. [Julia](https://julialang.org) is a dynamically typed compiled programming language developed at [MIT](https://julia.mit.edu) for general purpose computing. [Julia](https://julialang.org) has a number of interesting features, and is [an open source project available under the MIT license](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). [Julia](https://julialang.org) is available on all major computing platforms and operating sytstems (macOS, Windows and Linux). In addition, in this course we'll be using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com) to compose and run our [Julia](https://julialang.org) programs.\n",

    "## BSTModelKit.jl installation\n",
    "If you already have [Julia](https://julialang.org) installed on your system, then you can direcrly install `BSTModelKit.jl` using the package mode in the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#The-Julian-mode). The [package mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) allows the user to add, delete or update external [Julia](https://julialang.org) packages. A user enters [package mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) by hitting the ``]`` key which brings up the [package mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) prompt ``pkg>``. At this prompt, users can manage the packages that are installed globally, or in the local project environment.\n",

    "### Installation and Requirements for Julia\n",
    "[Julia](https://julialang.org), which runs on all major systems, can be downloaded from the [Julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Select the appropriate download version, and then follow the instructions for installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, before downloading [Julia](https://julialang.org), please see the specific instructions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### macOS\n",
    "On macOS, a ``julia-1.x.x-mac64.dmg`` installation file is contained in the download, which contains the executable ``Julia-1.x.app``. Installation of [Julia](https://julialang.org) on macOS works the same as any other Mac software: drag the Julia-1.x.app to Applications Folder. [Julia](https://julialang.org) runs on macOS 10.9 Mavericks or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch [Julia](https://julialang.org) from the command line, you'll need to update your ``PATH`` environmental variable to include the location of [Julia](https://julialang.org); add the following line to the ``.zshrc`` file in your home directory using the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org) or some other editor (path on macOS for version `1.8`, your path may be different):\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "export PATH=\"$PATH:/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can create a [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to a [Julia](https://julialang.org) version of your choosing by executing the following commands in the [Terminal on macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac):\n",
    "\n",
    "```zsh\n",
    "sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\n",
    "sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/julia\n",
    "sudo ln -s /Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux and FreeBSD\n",
    "The official generic binaries from the downloads page can be used to install [Julia](https://julialang.org) on Linux and FreeBSD. The following set of commands downloads the latest version of Julia into a directory named ``julia-1.7.3``:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.7/julia-1.7.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n",
    "tar zxvf julia-1.7.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The generic Linux and FreeBSD binaries do not require any special installation steps. Thus, once [Julia](https://julialang.org) has been downloaded and unpackaged, it can be moved to wherever you wish. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to start [Julia](https://julialang.org) you'll need to update your ``PATH`` environmental variable to point the installation location. Add the following line the `.bashrc` file in your home directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/<Julia directory>/bin\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "Although [Julia](https://julialang.org) can run on Windows directly, the teaching team asks that all Windows users install [the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), along with the latest [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) distribution, to run [Julia](https://julialang.org) in a Linux environment.  Instructions on how to install WSL can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once [the Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) has been installed, [Julia](https://julialang.org) can installed following the [Generic Linux instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd).\n",
    "\n",
    "(content:references:vscode-installation)=\n",
    "### Installation and Requirments for VSCode\n",
    "[Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a source-code editor made by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/?ql=4) for Windows, Linux, and macOS. VSCode supports debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring for various programming languages, including [Julia](https://julialang.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install VSCode, go to the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) homepage and click on the download button ({numref}`fig-vscode-download`):\n",

    "To download Visual Studio Code, click on the download button and follow the on-screen instructions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once VSCode has been installed, we need to install the [Julia extension for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia). The [Julia extension for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia) enables syntax highligting, access to a modern debugger, built-in dynamic autocompletion, inline results, plot pane, integrated REPL, variable view, code navigation, and many other advanced language features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the [Julia extension for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia), open VSCode and navigate to the [extensions panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).
